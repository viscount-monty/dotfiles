# .dotfiles
A backup of the configuration files which reside in the home directory of Linux operating systems.

This approach supersedes the "home directory is a repo with everything ignored except what I want to back up" as that resulted in some undesired behaviour, specifically with Google Antigravity agents not having access to files covered by the .gitignore file (everything in the home directory other thand a few config files)

- Based on this [this gist](https://gist.github.com/viscount-monty/f4c42fd3790f239ac0ca0c72a742d897)
